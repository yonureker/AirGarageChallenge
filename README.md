## Recent Enforcement Leaderboard

**Challenge**: Create a single page React or React Native app that shows an ordered list of how recently our parking lots have been enforced, and who enforced it last. You should show the parking lot name, the username of the enforcer, and the minutes since last enforcement, sorted by recency.
